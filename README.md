# Waste Bin Level Prediction

## Overview
This project presents a machine learning solution to improve urban waste management by predicting whether a municipal waste collection bin will be full at the time of pickup. By reliably predicting waste volumes, operations teams can skip unnecessary pickups, optimize collection routes, and reduce overall costs.

## Problem Statement
Municipal waste collection faces several operational challenges:
- Bins overflowing before pickup.
- Unnecessary pickups for bins with low waste levels.
- Inefficient routing of collection trucks.

This model aims to predict whether a bin is Full (1) or Not Full (0), helping decision-makers optimize the operations.

## Data
The dataset describes features related to waste bins across various locations. 
Key columns:
- `location_type` (Residential, Commercial, Industrial)
- `avg_daily_waste_kg`
- `days_since_last_pickup`
- `weather` (Normal vs Rainy)
- `festival_week` (0 vs 1)
- `bin_capacity_kg`
- `is_full` (Target variable)

## Setup & Installation
1. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
   ```
2. Place the dataset `waste bin data.csv` in the root directory.
3. Run the complete analysis, feature engineering, and model training script:
   ```bash
   python waste_management.py
   ```

## Workflow & Deliverables
1. **Data Exploration**
   - Investigated missing values and filled them suitably with median and mode strategies depending on the data type.
   - Identified class distributions and potential impacts of features like weather and festival_week.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - `estimated_current_waste_kg`: Multiplied the average daily waste generated by the days since the last pickup.
   - `fill_ratio_estimate`: The estimated waste divided by the bin capacity.
   - `adjusted_fill_ratio`: Multiplier applied during festival weeks.

3. **Modeling — Random Forest with Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Selected **Random Forest Classifier** for its ability to handle complex feature interactions (e.g., location type × weather × festival week), robustness to outliers, and built-in feature importance.
   - Used **GridSearchCV** (5-fold cross-validation, F1 scoring) to tune the following hyperparameters:
     | Hyperparameter | Search Values |
     |---|---|
     | `n_estimators` | 50, 100, 200, 300 |
     | `max_depth` | None, 10, 20, 30 |
     | `min_samples_split` | 2, 5, 10 |
     | `min_samples_leaf` | 1, 2, 4 |
     | `max_features` | sqrt, log2 |
   - The best parameters and best cross-validation F1 score are printed by the script at runtime.

4. **Evaluation**
   - The tuned model is evaluated on a held-out 20% test set (stratified split).
   - Metrics reported: **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1 Score**, and a full **Classification Report**.
   - **Precision**: High precision ensures the operations team doesn't dispatch trucks to non-full bins, saving fuel and labour.
   - **Recall**: High recall ensures overflowing bins are not missed, reducing hygiene complaints.

## Business Interpretation & Impact
- **Cost Reduction**: Predicting non-full bins avoids wasted labor hours and vehicle wear-and-tear.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Operations can schedule dynamic routes instead of static ones.
- **Strategic Allocation**: Consistently overflowing bins can be replaced with larger ones based on long-term model predictions.

## Future Improvements for Production
If we were building this in a real-world scenario, we would aim to include:
- **IoT Sensors**: Direct volume and weight signals from bins.
- **Routing Integrations**: Connecting prediction probabilities with Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) software to give optimized directions to truck drivers.
- **Real-time Traffic and Weather**: Using real-time data to forecast dynamic ETAs.
